# Testing-with-puppeteer
What is Puppeteer?
Puppeteer is a Node.js library developed by Google that lets you control headless Chrome through the DevTools Protocol.

It is a tool for automating testing in your application using headless Chrome or Chromebit devices, without requiring any browser extensions like Selenium Webdriver or PhantomJS.

Puppeteer lets you automate the testing of your web applications. With it, you can run tests in the browser and then see the results in real-time on your terminal.

Puppeteer uses the WebDriver protocol to connect with the browser and simulate user interaction with HTML elements or pages.
